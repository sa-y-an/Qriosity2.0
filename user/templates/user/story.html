            A person who ones had a happy family loving parents, but soon the
            reality for him shattered. His father started abusing him and his
            mother. He would not spare anyone. At school he was bullied no on
            cared for him except his mother. But one day he had enough, his
            father was an ugly he needed to get rid of, so one day when he came
            he saw his father about to kill his mother and he snapped. He took
            the hammer lying on the side and smashed his father's head
            repeatedly. His mother was baffled but she loved him no matter what
            and took the blame of killing him. But the tragedy does not end here
            his mother was brutally killed by a cellmate. He had lost all hope.
            No one provided justice to his mother. The accused was not punished.
            He thought world needed someone to punish the evil ones and took it
            upon himself to do that.

            The first round will test if you are worthy to save the world or
            not. The answer has inspired me and is something related to
            something close to my heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ones whom I shall deem worthy will be given a chance to save
            their pathetic world. The you know the answer but will you be able
            to find them…. Because the clock is ticking….tick tok tick tok
